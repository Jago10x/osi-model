      <li>The __________ is the portion of a frame that NIC uses to determine whether data in the recieved frame is valid.</li>

      <dt>direct routing:</dt>
      <dd>if two computers on the same network need to communicate, the packets dont require a router. in an IEEE 802.3 network, the sending entity encapsulates the packet in an Ethernet frame, binds the destination address, and transmits the resulting frame directly to its destination. this is called direct routing which is performed by ARP</dd>
      
    <dt>indirect routing:</dt>
    <dd>If two computers are not on the same network, they must send the IP packet to the router for delivery. this is called indirect routing</dd>
    <dt>static routing vs dynamic routing</dt>
    <dd>a static router contains routing information tables that must be built and updated manually. If a certiain route doesnt exist in the table, it will be unable to communicate with that network<br><br>
    a dynamic router on the other hand communicates with other dynmic routers nto calculate routes automatically using routing protocols such as  RIP and Open shortest path first (OSPF)
