Herman Hollerith Tabluating Machine company: electromechanical tabluating machine, like the step reckoner, using punch cards. he founded the 
TMC merged with other companies which became IBM(International Business Machine co)


1942 IBM Harvard Mark 1
765K components, 500 miles of wire, used a motor, most were relays/transistors. theyre like pipes. a good relay could flip at most 50 times/second. isnt fast enough, could do 3 addition/subtractions per second
multiplication in 6 seconds	
division in 15 secs. it was limited by ware and tear and would have to be replaced frequently. bugs would get stuck in them hence we get the word bug.

1956, thermiionic valvewas replaced by vaccume tubes

8 bit computers only had 256 possible color combinations

then 32 bit came out which would represent 4,294,967,296 different colors
the largest number is 4,294,967,295
this isnt enough as even the worlds population is above this figure.

they use the first bit to denote positive/negative numbers.
